Personnal Basic
===============

Building my own basic setup for symfony.  

This repository will have 2 "master branch" :
  - master :    Main branch with the basic build including an admin interface.
  - user :      Extension of the basic build with a user manager part.  
  
For now i'm gonna start with a 2.8 version aimed at being clone when i need it.  
Later, i'm probably gonna upgrade it to the Symfony3 LTS and even later, i may try to convert this to a bundle.
